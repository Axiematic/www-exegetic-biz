### Day 1: Spreadsheets

Spreadsheets are the most pervasive tool for working with data. Whether you're doing a quick-and-dirty analysis, creating charts or building a massive simulation, a spreadsheet is often one of the best tools for the job.

- Sorting and filtering
- Cell references (within and between sheets)
- Functions and formulas
	- Maths
	- Text
	- Dates and times
	- Lookup
- Conditional formatting
- Data validation
- Pivot tables
- Creating charts
- Macros

### Day 2: SQL and Databases

Most data today are stored in databases. Being able to quickly and effectively extract precisely the data that you want from a database is an invaluable skill.

- Database concepts
- Writing a simple query
- Filtering rows and selecting columns
- Creating summaries
- Joining data from multiple tables

### Day 3: R

Being able to record the steps in an analysis as a script allows you to make the entire process repeatable. Repeatability is paramount for any type of analysis, especially in research. R allows you to write step-by-step scripts for your analyses and has more than 10 000 add-on packages which cater for almost any conceivable problem. Oh, and R is free software!

- Importing data
- Manipulating data
- Creating visualisations
- Automated reporting

### Day 4: Python

Python is another language well suited to analytical work. Python excels for integration with other systems and producing production-ready systems. Like R, Python is also free software!

- Importing data
- Manipulating data
- Creating visualisations
- Simple Machine Learning
