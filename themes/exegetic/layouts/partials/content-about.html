              <p>The biggest challenge to initiating and maintaining a Data Science capability is finding the right people.</p>

              <p>Large enterprises are able to sustain an in-house Data Science team.</p>

              <p>Smaller businesses find it more challenging. They understand that data-driven processes are essential to modern business. But where to find skilled Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Statisticians and Report Designers to execute their analytics projects?</p>

              <p>That's where Exegetic comes into the picture.</p>

              <p>We recognise that there are many challenges to adopting and maintaining a small and nimble Data Science team. That's why we offer a flexible and economical solution: Data Science on Demand.</p>

              <h2>Data Science on Demand</h2>
