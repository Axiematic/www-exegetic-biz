                    <p>The Data Science landscape is complicated and convoluted. Your employees already understand your business and industry. We'll help them augment this knowledge with the fundamental concepts of Data Science, tools and techniques to turn aspiring analysts into competent and productive practitioners.</p>
                    <p>We focus on applied learning, working with real data and solving real problems.</p>
