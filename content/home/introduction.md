## What is Exegetic?

The biggest challenge to initiating and maintaining a Data Science capability is finding the right people.

Large enterprises are able to sustain an in-house Data Science team.

Smaller businesses find it more challenging. They understand that data-driven processes are essential to modern business. But where to find skilled Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Statisticians and Report Designers to execute their analytics projects?

That's where Exegetic comes into the picture.

We recognise that there are many challenges to adopting and maintaining a small and nimble Data Science team. That's why we offer a flexible and economical solution: Data Science on Demand.

## Data Science on Demand

Many companies have Data Science projects they’d like to start, but lack the necessary expertise to get them off the ground. Recruiting can be a slow and expensive process.

With Exegetic you can get up and running with your Data Science project immediately.

Our Data Science On Demand service has numerous benefits:

Description of different types of clients (https://medium.com/@rchang/my-two-year-journey-as-a-data-scientist-at-twitter-f0c13298aee6). These can be rephrased in terms of "data maturity".

At early stage start-ups: the primary analytic focus is to implement logging, to build ETL processes, to model data and design schemas so data can be tracked and stored. The goal here is focused on building the analytics foundation rather than analysis itself.

At mid-stage growing start-ups: Since the company is growing, the data is probably growing too. The data platform needs to adapt, but with the foundation laid out already, there will be a natural shift to insight generation. Unless the company leverages Data Science for its strategic differentiation to start with, many analytics work are around defining KPI, attributing growth, and finding the next opportunities to grow

Companies who achieved scale: When the company scales up, data also scales up. It needs to leverage data to create or maintain competitive edge. e.g. Search results need to be better, recommendations need to be more relevant, logistics or operations need to be more efficient — this is the time where specialist like ML engineers, Optimization experts, Experimentation designers can play a huge role in stepping up the game.
