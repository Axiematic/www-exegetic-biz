*"Wow, you've come from so far!"* was often one of the first comments I had when meeting someone new at the annual useR conference in Toulouse last week. Yes, Cape Town is quite far, and although we are the same time zone, it's a long journey from the tip of Africa. But, at the same time, although I was in a new, foreign country, and didn't know anyone else attending, there was a feeling of familiarity from the time I arrived. 

As David Smitth put it during the introduction sessions for useR newbies on the Monday evening "I came to R for the software, but I stayed for the community." This line rang true throughout the conference, not only as it was tweeted a lot, but also as it really embodied the essence - that we were all there as we spoke a common language, no matter our mother tongue, and wanted to share, learn and support each other as a community. This is not just true of the conference, but was the first time I had experienced this at an international level and in person. 

I also would not have been able to make this journey without the support from useR and being awarded a Diversity Scholarship, for which I am incredibly grateful. Thank you!

And since we are in Toulouse, let's not forget the infamous "chocolatine",  of which there were in abundance during our coffee breaks! And don't call it a "pain au chocolate" unless you want to start a pastry war with the local Toulossains!

## Tidy Developer Day
Before jumping straight into the conference, I took advantage of being in Toulouse for a week and my time there to also sign up for the "Tidy Developer Day". I wasn't too sure what to expect and felt a little apprehensive walking into the room. But, the colourful stickies being placed on the wall, the presence of a gong and happy faces, told me it was going to be a good day! This was an excellent way to break down any barriers that one might be feeling or experiencing in order to start contributing to open source projects. I thought that they way the Tidyverse/RStudio team structured the day made it really accessible and many people learned how to set up Github, clone repositories and make their first pull requests. Furthermore, grabbing one of the yellow stickies (representing a real issue on Github) meant you could start out with something to do with documentation - a really great entry point! 

How fun to be able to contribute to a package such as `ggplot`?! Even if it is only to add some examples to the documentation.

It&#39;s definitely very satisfying seeing these &quot;sticky&quot; issues physically migrate from one wall to the next. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> <a href="https://t.co/0SOQwz3sYL">pic.twitter.com/0SOQwz3sYL</a></p>&mdash; Megan Beckett (@mbeckett_za) <a href="https://twitter.com/mbeckett_za/status/1148231350958350336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I thoroughly enjoyed the second issue I worked on, which was about the confusing, and also probably offensive, use of gender in the Starwars dataset included in the `dplyr` package. Read more about the issue [here](). I found this really interesting and stimulating to work through as it highlights many important issues that we constantly need to be aware of and strive to improve, whether in our conversations in society or in our datasets that we work with for examples in training workshops. I spent the afternoon researching the Starwars characters, and proposed some changes and inclusions in the data set, including how "Droids" are classified in terms of gender, depending on how they had been programmed, and noteworthy characters such as Jabba the Hut, who is hermaphroditic and identifies as masculine. I'm looking forward to some feedback on this [pull request](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/pull/4480) and hoping that we will see an improvement in this dataset going forward. Furthermore, I feel a lot less intimidated and much more excited to get stuck in and make further contributions to the Tidyverse, and other open source projects, in the future.

## Tutorials
Just as the cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life, so too should a package be for your R code! Since joining Exegetic Analytics, I have learned how to package your R code into a package, whether you're aiming to get it onto CRAN or share with colleagues or doing work for a client as a consultant. Therefore, I was excited to join Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester for their Package Development tutorial. 

My main take away points were:

![](/img/blog/usethis.png#floatright)

1. Use this -> `usethis`! Jenny Bryan demonstrated during the tutorial, as well as in her [talk](https://github.com/jennybc/2019-07_useR-toulouse-usethis) during the conference, about how to help automate your workflow during project and package development with the `usethis` package. 

2. Furthermore, I think one of the most handy tips I learned was using `devtools::load_all()` during package development to simulate what happens when the package is installed and loaded without actually having to do that each time. Big time saver for quick iterations!

3. Write unit tests! Jim Hester gave a really concice and clear tutorial, which I would highly reccommend going through, to understand what is meant by writing tests using `testthat` and how to do so.  See the slides [here](https://github.com/jennybc/pkg-dev-tutorial/blob/master/testing.pdf).

Mastering Docker has been on my to do list as a critical skill for awhile now. Whilst the tutorial from Tobias Verbeke (Open Analytics) was in depth and covered a lot of ground, I know that I just need to roll up my sleeves and get some practical experience now. 

In true #Rstats spirit (as captured in the tweet below), the materials and resources for the tutorials are online. Suthira Owlarn collated them in [this repository](https://github.com/sowla/useR2019-materials) for easy reference. I'm particularly keen to go through Colin Fay's "[Advanced use of your favorite IDE - RStudio](https://github.com/ColinFay/user2019workshop)" which was apparently very insightful, with lots of handy tips and tricks.
