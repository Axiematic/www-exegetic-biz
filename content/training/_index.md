				    				I really enjoyed the interactive training: concepts introduced and then made to practice. The fact that I can review/redo my exercises in my own time makes it a very useful experience. The references to outside help and add-ons are also very useful. It was also great to learn from other participants.

									Both Megan and Andrew are wonderful trainers. Andrew's excitement in explaining concepts was much appreciated - he's very good at conveying what the code means and what it achieves, so it was easy to grasp some of the concepts. Nothing appeared too difficult, all achievable with practice.

				    				My thesis-writing experience has completely turned around. It went from being this scary insecure experience to a really confident one because I feel so much more equipped to delve into my data. I really can't thank you guys enough!

				    				That was the best training course I have attended. Andrew and Megan are exceptional speakers and patient teachers. Despite the large volume of content, the training was interactive. This ensured that we each received individual attention, and were able to keep up with the pace.
