The Shiny package makes it easy to create interactive web applications using R.

In this workshop you will learn how to build Shiny applications from scratch. After the workshop you will:

- understand the structure of a Shiny application (UI and server);
- be able to assemble an attractive UI;
- understand reactivity and how the UI and server communicate with each other; and
- know how to deploy a Shiny application.
