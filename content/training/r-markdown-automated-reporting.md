Do you spend a lot of time generating reports? Do you end up regenerating tables and figures when new data become available? Is this a complicated and error-prone process? If so, then this course is for you!

Automating your reporting process will save you time and reduce errors.

## Details

**Duration** 1 day

**Who should attend?** The course is aimed at students, academics and professionals who need to generate data-driven reports.

**Objectives**

Reports are an important artefact of research and analysis. Often these reports need to be frequently generated or updated. Ideally this should be done in a reproducible manner. It's is an ideal opportunity for automation! In this course you'll learn how to use R and Markdown to efficiently generate sophisticated and visually appealing reports.

**Outcomes**

Participants will be able to generate reports which include text, tables, figures, code and analytical results. They will also be able to flexibly style the reports.

**Requirements**

Participants are assumed to have prior exposure to R, or at least to programming of some variety. Ideally participants should have completed the [Data Wrangling]({{< ref "r-data-wrangling.md" >}}) and [Visualisation]({{< ref "r-visualisation.md" >}}) modules.
