  The course is for students, academics and professionals. Version Control is not just for developers. It's an indispensable tool for anybody who creates content on a computer (for example, source code, documents, presentations or web sites). It also facilitates collaboration between mutliple people working on the same set of files.
intro: |
  A Version Control system is a fundamental tool for developers, analysts and reseachers. It provides the following benefits:

    - a complete history of revisions (and the ability to revert to older versions);
    - backups; and
    - enables collaboration.

  Git is the most pervasive Version Control system today. It works well on all projects, from a few files and a single developer to thousands of files and hundreds of developers.
