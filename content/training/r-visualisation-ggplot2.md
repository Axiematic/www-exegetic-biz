title: "Visualisation with ggplot2 and plotly"
subjects: ['R']
draft: false
---

The [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) package has become the *de facto* standard for making plots in R. It's possible to quickly put together a simple plot for exploratory purposes. However, with a bit of effort such a plot can be transformed into a work of art.

This hands-on workshop will introduce the basic components of ggplot2 and show how they can be combined to form sophisticated visualisations. We'll then take a look at extensions for labelling points in congested scatterplots and producing animations.
