title: "Machine Learning â€” Getting Started"
subjects: ['Python']
subjects_weight: 20
draft: false
topic: true
duration: 1 day
who: |
  The course is aimed at students, academics and professionals who want to use Machine Learning.
objectives: |
  Machine Learning is a big (and rather hot!) topic. In this course you'll learn how to apply Machine Learning to two types of problems: Classification and Regression. Although Machine Learning models are often treated as black boxes, you'll learn (in an unthreatening, low-math way) how these models work. You'll also learn how to appropriately prepare your data, how to build and test a model, and how to generate predictions.
outcomes: |
  Participants will be able to build Classification and Regression models on real world data. They will understand how the models work and how to interpret model predictions.
requirements: |
  Participants are assumed to be familiar with working with data in Python using Numpy and Pandas.
