Deep Learning is a vast and convoluted topic. Itâ€™s hard to know where to start.

This workshop will introduce you to the fundamentals behind Deep Learning and show you how to get started building models using Python and Keras. You'll learn some of the underlying maths (although a PhD in Mathematics will not be required to follow along!) and work through examples using Jupyter Notebooks.
