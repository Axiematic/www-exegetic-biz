Deep Learning is a vast and convoluted topic. It’s hard to know where to start.

This workshop will introduce you to the fundamentals behind Deep Learning and show you how to get started building models using Python and Keras. You'll learn some of the underlying maths (although a PhD in Mathematics will not be required to follow along!) and work through examples using Jupyter Notebooks.

<!--
Via analogy to biological neurons and human perception, this course is an introduction to artificial neural networks that brings high-level theory to life with interactive labs featuring TensorFlow, the most popular open-source Deep Learning library. Essential theory will be covered in a manner that provides students with an intuitive understanding of Deep Learning’s underlying foundations. Paired with hands-on code run-throughs in Jupyter notebooks as well as strategies for overcoming common pitfalls, this foundational knowledge will empower individuals with no previous understanding of neural networks to build production-ready Deep Learning applications across the major contemporary families: Convolutional Nets for machine vision; Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Nets for natural language processing and time series analysis; Generative Adversarial Networks for producing realistic images; and Reinforcement Learning for playing video games.
