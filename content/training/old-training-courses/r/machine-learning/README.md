# Machine Learning with R

## Course Duration

There's a lot of material in the *Machine Learning with R* course. As a consequence we offer this course in two versions:

**Short Version** (duration: 1 day) covering:

- Introductory Concepts
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Model Evaluation

These modules have been chosen since they cover a selection of topics which will give a reasonable grounding in the concepts and techniques required to do Machine Learning in R.

**Full Version** (duration: 3 days) covering all topics.
