# Time Series Analysis with R

## Course Duration

This course can be presented at either an Introductory or Advanced level.

**Introductory Version** (duration: 1 day) is application oriented and shows how R can be used to solve Time Series problems without digging too deeply into the theoretical details.

**Advanced Version** (duration: 2 days) delves into the theoretical details and explores the theory behind the models.

Both versions cover a similar set of examples and exercises.
