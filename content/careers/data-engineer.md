We're looking for a Data Engineer. Somebody who will be responsible for the full gamut of data management tasks. Somebody who will work closely with our Data Scientists to provide pristine (or the closest possible facsimile) data for their analyses. Somebody who takes pleasure in wrestling with integration problems and messy, unstructured data.

As a Data Engineer you will be responsible for expanding and optimizing our data flow and data management systems.
