We're looking for an entry level Data Scientist. Somebody who has the required technical skills, but not necessarily the experience. Somebody who is keen to learn and grow rapidly.

As a Junior Data Scientist you will be working on a diverse range of projects. You'll be part of a small team and will have one or more dedicated mentors who will guide your progress. We will challenge you daily and push your boundaries continuously. You'll grow quickly and learn a lot.

You'll be working closely with other members of the team. You'll be exposed to a bunch of different tasks using a diverse range of tools, technologies and techniques.
