The [`caret`](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) package exposes functions which ease the process of creating predictive models.

We'll look at the following functionality:

	* pre-processing;
	* train/test splitting;
	* feature importance and feature selection;
	* model evaluation (using cross validation and bootstrapping);
	* model tuning.
