- All projects must be under version control.
- Every project must be linked to a cloud repository usually on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/exegetic), or [Github](https://github.com/datawookie/www-exegetic-biz).
- The cloud repository for all client projects must be *private* (unless explicitly stipulated otherwise by the client).
- The cloud repository for other projects may be private or public, depending on the nature of the project.
- Work must be pushed to the cloud repository frequently (*at least* once per day).
- Commit messages must be informative.
- Every repository should have a `.gitignore` file in the root folder. Additional `.gitignore` file can be added to sub-folders as required.
