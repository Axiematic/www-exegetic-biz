title: "Policy – Timesheets"
draft: true
documents: ['Policy']

Billable hours are the core of operating a consulting company. Billable hours generate revenue, and that’s how we pay salaries (and also fund other things like hackathons and conferences).

We keep track of billable hours by filling out a timesheet. The information on the timesheet should be sufficiently detailed that our clients can feel comfortable about the hours for which we are billing them. We want our clients to trust us. Submitting detailed and accurate timesheets is one way that we can establish and maintain that trust.

We also don’t want to micromanage you. Timesheets are filled on an honour system. We trust you to fill them out honestly. We want to get to the end of the month and have confidence in the validity of your timesheet.

We want you to actively seek out billable work. But, at the same time, we don’t want you to ever inflate your hours. If you think that you are going to fall short of targets, please speak up! We’d much rather learn about this sooner than later.
### Purpose
1. To ensure accurate and detailed completion of timesheets, with the purpose of ensuring client satisfaction.
2. Timesheets help us to know how long it typically takes to complete a given task. This makes it easier for us to quote on new work.
3. Higher productivity, less paperwork and more transparency.

### Statement
Timesheet submission:

- Everyone is required to submit a timesheet.
- Completed timesheets must be submitted no later than 09:00 on the first working day following the end of the month.
- It’s your responsibility to ensure that your timesheet is complete and accurate.

Timesheet Entries:

- Log a separate entry for each discrete piece of work that you do.

    - Give a concise description of what you were working on. From the perspective of the client, this is very important.
    - Provide a link to a relevant Trello card (if available).

- Ideally you want entries to correspond to around an hour, which gives a granular indication of what work has been done.
- For brief tasks (like writing a one-line email) it does not make sense to log a separate entry. Just lump it in with other work. Use your discretion!
- Not all time logged need be “billable”. If you are doing work that does not relate to a client then log that time against Exegetic


|Billable| Not billable|
|:-------|:-------------|
|meetings (online or in person)| upskilling (not related to project)|
|emails (reading or writing)| Exegetic standups and catchups|
|research (directly related to project)|
|upskilling (directly related to project)|
|travel (as approved per project) and|
|actually working on the project!| 


*Some of this might seem brutal, but bear in mind that any time you spend on the above items is time that you cannot spend doing work for another client. So it makes sense that the client is billed for that time.

Timesheet targets:

These are goals. We fully appreciate that they will not always be achievable, and that they will vary according to your project load, but here is what we are aiming for:

- You need to log on average 8 hours per day for every (working) day of the month.
- Seniors should strive to ensure that at least 85% of their logged time is billable.
- Juniors should strive to ensure that at least 70% of their logged time is billable.

Contractors:

- Please log all time associated with client projects as well as Standups and Catchups.
- We want contract staff to be involved in personal development and team building activities (like hackathons and Monday Munch), but we are currently not in a position to pay contractors for their participation in these activities.
