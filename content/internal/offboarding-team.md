## Purpose

To ensure a smooth transition and encourage the person who is leaving to share their expertise with their successor.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees (including contractors).

## Employee's Responsibilities

#### Knowledge transfer

- To ensure that your projects can continue to run after your departure please schedule a handover meeting with whomever is taking over your projects. Points to include in this meeting:
    - A brief background on your history with the client
    - Work you have completed for them
    - Status report on all ongoing projects (due dates, deliverables etc)
    - Necessary contacts
    - All documentation required for the project
    - Any other relevant information
    - links to the up-to-date repos
- Schedule a meeting with your client(s) to introduce them to their new POC at Exegetic and make sure they are included in all correspondence thereafter

*The above should ideally be complete as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition

#### Within the two weeks of your notice period: 

- Fill in a copy of the Exit interview questionnaire
- Settle any cash advances
- Ensure your manager has your up to date contact information in case they need to get hold of you once you leave
- Start transferring all your work files across to the relevant "<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aEcAcSELH-lKx8AF3bpY9GLd9LMiTSFH?usp=sharing">work-content</a>" folder. This should include subfolders for each client you have dealt with and a copy of all of the information from your handover meeting(s)
- Ensure that all of your work has been pushed to the relevant repos

#### Withing the last week of your notice period
- Obtain email forwarding address from your manager
- Return any company property such as:
    - petrol card
    - internet dongle
    - laptop
    - cellphone
- Attend your exit interview

## Exegetic's Responsibilities

#### General 

- Make sure you are available to answer any of your departing colleague's questions
- Set time aside to review your colleague's answers before scheduling their exit interview
- Communicate openly and honestly with remaining employees to mitigate speculation and other issues that invariably arise when an employee leaves the company or layoffs occur.

#### Prepare Paperwork
- Ensure that the employee's official letter of resignation is appropriately filed
- Non-disclosure and non-compete agreements

#### Exit interview questions

##### 
- Why did you begin looking for a new job?
- What ultimately led you to accept the new position?
- What did you like most and least about your job?
- Do you think the job description matches these expectations? Would you change it?
- Were goals and expectations clear to you?
- Talk about your colleague(s). What did they do well? What could they use work on? What are some recommendations you might give them (anonymously, of course) that could help them improve?
- Did you receive enough feedback on your job? Did it help?
- Did you have all the resources necessary to do your job? If not, what else might have helped?
- Did you feel you had room to grow here?
- Would you work here again?
- Would you recommend this company or this position to a friend? Why or why not?
- If you could change anything about your job or the company, what would you change?
- How can our company improve training and development programs?
- Non-compete and non-disclosure reminders (if relevant).
