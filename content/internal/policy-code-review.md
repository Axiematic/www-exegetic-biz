title: "Policy â€“ Code Review"
draft: true
documents: ['Policy']
---

* When submitting work for peer review, the work should be kept to a well defined, single task. An entire application in it's entirety should **not** be sent for review, rather a specific feature of an application.
* Ensure the piece of work that is to be reviewed is described on a project management console. A separate board should exist for the task where it is described, the name of the relevant scripts and the branch on which the work was done, are listed.
* Ensure the code has been thoroughly tested prior to sending the code for peer review - see the [version control](https://www.exegetic.biz/internal/procedure-version-control/) procedure for this.
