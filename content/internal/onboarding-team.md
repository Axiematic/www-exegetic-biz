A form to collect payroll and personal information will be emailed to all new Exegetic employees atleast 3 days before their first offcial day.

Exegetic will assemble a welcome package to be emailed to the employee on their first day. The welcome package will contain:

 - job description,

 - links to Exegetic's policies and procedures

#### Onboarding Period

The designated buddy and new employee will meet regularly to review how you are settling into your Exegetic 

Generally, the Onboarding period will run for two weeks from the Employee’s
commencement date. However, depending on the needs of the employee and how quickly they are able to integrate into the position, the onboarding period may be completed prior to this.


## Buddy Program

To facilitate the new employee’s integration, Exegetic has introduced a buddy program, which pairs up the new employees with a more experienced peer. The purpose of the program is to facilitate the new employee’s integration in a more informal manner. 

Individuals wishing to be buddies for new employees are encouraged to. When a new employee starts, [Human
Resources/their supervisor] will assign them to a buddy based on their position.
