### Subsistence

*A subsistence allowance is given for expenses incurred in respect of personal subsistence and incidental costs such as meals and drinks.*

A budget of R350 per day will be allocated for meals. This amount is broken down as follows:

- dinner — R150
- lunch — R100 and
- breakfast — R100.

Do not claim for meals which are included with accommodation or an event. All receipts must be attached to an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W2qg_hrtCQlbc7B-3EHQHm3sWdsg-QqL2UnMbjxl2pk/edit?usp=sharing">expense claim</a>.

<!-- Exegetic employees should select restaurants which are reasonably priced for the locality and which are consistent with normal living standards. A receipt is required for all entertainment expenses regardless of the amount. All receipts must be attached to an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W2qg_hrtCQlbc7B-3EHQHm3sWdsg-QqL2UnMbjxl2pk/edit?usp=sharing">expense claim</a>.

Business related meals for customers or with other employees must be described as follows:  date, amount, place and a brief explanation of the nature of business.  A list of names of those entertained must be included. Wine and bar tabs are reimbursable only if they are associated with a business meeting and are not excessive.  Entertaining other employees, unless for stated business purpose, is not a reimbursable expense. -->
