### Subsistence

*A subsistence allowance is given for expenses incurred in respect of personal subsistence and incidental costs such as meals and drinks.*

A budget of R350 per day will be allocated for meals. As a guideline please allocate R100 for breakfast, R100 for lunch and R150 for dinner.

Exegetic employees should select restaurants which are reasonably priced for the locality and which are consistent with normal living standards. A receipt is required for all entertainment expenses regardless of the amount. All receipts must be attached to an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W2qg_hrtCQlbc7B-3EHQHm3sWdsg-QqL2UnMbjxl2pk/edit?usp=sharing">expense claim</a>.

Business related meals for customers or with other employees must be described as follows:  date, amount, place and a brief explanation of the nature of business.  A list of names of those entertained must be included. Wine and bar tabs are reimbursable only if they are associated with a business meeting and are not excessive.  Entertaining other employees, unless for stated business purpose, is not a reimbursable expense.
