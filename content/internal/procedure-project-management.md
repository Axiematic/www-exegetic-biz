This procedure refers to how we project manage clients and projects associated with clients. Refer to <a href="https://www.exegetic.biz/internal/procedure-clients/">Clients Procedure</a>) for onboarding and setting up for a new client. 

## Internal structure

- Each project will have at least one person working on it, namely the Lead Data Scientist, and then possibly 1 or more Junior Data Scientists.
- The Lead Data Scientist is responsible for overall project management, including managing timelines, expectations and requirements and communication with the client.
- Where necessary, when Juniors email the clients directly, they must always cc the Lead in on any communication sent.
