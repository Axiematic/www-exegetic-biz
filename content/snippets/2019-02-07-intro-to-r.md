## A little bit of context
As a Junior Data Scientist (should this be capitalized, boss?), we’re always eager to get stuck into projects and do some statistical modelling. Aren’t we just the greatest? (boss?) That’s all fine and dandy, but having the right tools in your toolbox is just as important as building a predictive model that can outline to Elon his spending oopsies. An effective toolset can save us hours, if not _days_ when beginning to work with a project. 



## R: The R Project for Statistical Computing
And that's where R comes in. R, much like other high-level languages (see [Python](https://www.python.org/)), allows to you worry less about implementing your own string-parsing function in a language such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), and rather spend your time on data analysis. Much like Python, a vast array of packages exist for R. But you don't even need to delve into the packages before you begin to experience some of the neat functions in R. Ever been too lazy enough to write a nested _for_ to loop through a 2D matrix? R has you covered!

### An example
Let's say we had a couple of days in the last month where we decided to visit the casino? Actually, scrap that - we visited the casino every (work) day for the last month! And to boot, we were lucky enough to record our earnings every day such that we could perform some analysis on our performance. First off, our dataset:


```{r}
week <- c("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th") #Note the creation of a vector of strings with the function c (for combine) ?
days <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
Monday <- c(10, -15, 25, 26) #and assign to a variable with <- instead of = ?
Tuesday <- c(58, -43, 1, -11)
Wednesday <- c(64, -24, 10, -3)
Thursday <- c(35, 20, 21, 13)
Friday <- c(7, 8, -12, -26)
```

Let's just say we wanted to calculate the average spending per day over the 4 week period? Maybe we should give the casino a miss on certain days of the week. Let's first create a data frame

``` {r}
casino_df <- data.frame(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, row.names=week)
```

A data frame has the variables of a data set as columns and the observations as rows. It's similar to a matrix, but allows for easier indexing, amongst other neat features storing *multiple variables* types in a single matrix. In this example, we only have numeric data, but there's nothing stopping us adding strings to accompany this numeric data. We can index in a classic matrix-style fashion or using

```{r}
casino_df$Monday #neat indexing
[1]  10 -15  25  26
casino_df[,1] #equivalent expression - where the first argument specifies all the rows
[1]  10 -15  25  26
```
which lists the entries for every Monday over the 4 week period. Returning to the problem of determining the average spending for each day of the week

```{r}
lapply(casino_df, mean)
$Monday
[1] 11.5

$Tuesday
[1] 1.25

$Wednesday
[1] 11.75

$Thursday
[1] 22.25

$Friday
[1] -5.75
```
_lapply_ (apply a function over a list) applies a function (in our case the _mean_ function) over a list. Pretty neat right? No nested _for_ loops in sight. We don't need to assign new variables to hold the summation of individual days, nor do we have to keep track of only applying the summation over the columns. R takes the reduction of boiler-plate code seriously and enables us to write condensed code which is still readable. We can see from our thorough analysis of the dataset that Thursday looks like feasible day to be at the casino. Maybe we should reduce our working hours per week and give Fridays a total miss?

## Datacamp

But where do I learn this all-encompassing, ultra-powerful statistical tool I hear you ask? Well on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com) of course! Datacamp is an online learning platform that focusses on interactive learning, which I've found to be the best type. There's no better way to learn than to get your hand dirty. [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com) covers a wide variety of topics ranging from subject matter such as Data Science to programming languages like R. It's really a great place get stuck in, at a pace that suits you.

## Closing thoughts
R is a programming language that's aimed at statistical analysis, and lately Data Science. It has neat, built-in functionality that allows us to write condensed, readable and efficient code - we'll touch on efficiency in a later post. The brief example illustrated how we can avoid repetitive code and condense our script dramatically. Being new to Data Science myself, I've personally enjoyed my first foray with R especially its elegant and efficient nature. R has a large, active [community](https://community.rstudio.com/community) that drives the language forward -make use of the Q&A! So what are you waiting for? Enrol in a free trial on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com) and start finding out some of those casino secrets using R today. And while you're at it, make sure you don't miss local R meetups and events!
