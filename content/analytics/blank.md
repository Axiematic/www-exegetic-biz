## Data

Big Data? Little Data? Doesn't matter. We're just interested in data.</p><p>From server logs to service histories, social media to sensors, spreadsheets to big databases. We'll use whatever data you have at your disposal.

We have experience with a vast variety of data types and forms. And we've learned that there's usually something interesting and useful to be found in most data.

## Automation

It doesn't make sense for your skilled employees to spend so much time doing mundane, repetitive tasks.

We believe in robust automated systems which will quietly and reliably perform these tasks, liberating your employees to concentrate on the dynamic components of your business.

## Automated Reporting

Generating reports by hand is mundane and error-prone. We build automated reports based on your data, which can be regenerated whenever the data changes or according to a schedule.

## Communication

Data Science results can be complex and nuanced. We communicate our analyses in ways that are meaningful, easy to digest and focused on addressing your problems.

If you want to know the nitty-gritty, we'll eviscerate every aspect of the problem and you can scrutinise the details.

Or we'll just cut to the chase and tell you the bottom line: concise results in plain English.

## Optimisation

Optimising your processes will result in improved efficiency, fewer errors, better quality results and higher morale.

Almost every aspect of a business is a candidate for optimisation. Improve alignment between supply and demand. Increase profit margins by reducing costs. Deliver efficiently by selecting shortest and quickest delivery routes. Devise effective pricing and promotion strategies that are optimal for every product within any market.

## Forecasting

Making informed predictions for the future can be incredibly powerful!

Next quarter's sales, the price of raw materials next month, product demand next week and the number of hits of your website tomorrow... With contemporary and evolving Data Science tools, all of these can be predicted with increasing confidence.

## Simulation

Would you like to experiment with new ideas without the commitment of having to implement them fully first?

We can build a simulation which will allow you to conduct such an experiment, tweak parameters and explore options.

A simulation will allow you to evaluate those ideas without impacting on current systems and processes.

Rapid Prototyping

We achieve rapid time-to-value, assembling a Proof of Concept or draft analysis within days of data exchange.

We then iterate quickly, focusing on the most pertinent aspects of the analysis. This allows us to transform experiments and prototypes into robust and reliable data solutions.

And you have control over the process every step of the way.
